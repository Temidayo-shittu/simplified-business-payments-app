## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

# Simplified Business Payments App Schema Design

## User Story

- This business application enables small businesses to manage their payments efficiently. 
- This app allows business owners to create profiles for each of their clients, track payment transactions, and receive real-time alerts for unpaid invoices.
- Only an admin can create a business-owner which in turn can update their profiles and details.
- A Business Owner can update his/her details and also login to their account.
- Business Owners' can only access information pertaining to themselves as they wont be able to access information concerning other business owners.
- Only Admin can get information about all clients and their transactions and other sensitive statistics concerning the clients.
- I enabled a validation which limits the access of clients' resources by anyone except the business-owner associated with the client or admin.

## Requirement Analysis

- Business owners should be able to set up profiles for their clients.
- Create a system that prevents multiple payments for the same invoice and tracks unpaid invoices.
- Develop a user-friendly platform for easy access and efficient payment management.


### Entities:

- Authentication: This allows for registering and enabling business-owners login to their account and also logging out.
- Admin: An admin is a business-owner that has a unique identifier, name, email, password, role amongst other features.
- Business-Owner: A Business-Owner has a unique identifier, name, email, password amongst other features.
- Client: They are created by their business-owners.
- Invoice: This provides statistical data for analytics and it shows the amount owed by clients and the due dates for payments.
- Payment-Transaction: This shows all the payment records for clients.
